        <h1>Towards a zero electricity bill</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old
            bulbs
            with LEDs, got a new firdge and super-efficient heat pump
            and
            you're
            still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let
            HT
            Green
            work with you to design and install a system that uses
            solar,
            wind
            or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for
            now
            and
            into the future.</p>

        <img src="images/geo250.jpg" alt="Geothermal Energy" class="content-image">
        <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The
            earth
            is
            warmer than the air and we can use this to heat your home.
            HT
            Green
            can engineer a solution to fit your situation to give you
            free
            plentiful home warming energy year-round.</p>
        <p>Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and
            environmentally
            friendly, but has previously been geographically limited to
            areas
            near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological
            advances
            have
            dramatically expanded the range and size of viable
            resources,
            especially for direct applications such as home heating.</p>
        <p>Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped
            deep
            within
            the earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of
            conventional fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has
            the
            potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed
            instead
            of fossil fuels.</p>

        <h1>Wind Turbines</h1>

        <img src="images/turbine250.jpg" alt="Wind Turbines" class="content-image">
        <p>If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to
            engineer a wind turbine system that generates electricity
            when
            the wind blows. Team a wind turbine with a solar PV system
            and
            you increase your energy generation potential.</p>
        <p>New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind
            turbine works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind
            turbine is installed.</p>
        <p>If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, before you
            buy from us,contact one of our wind power experts for the right
            advice.</p>
